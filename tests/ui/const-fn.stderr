  = note: closures need an RFC before allowed to be called in constant functions
  = note: calls in constant functions are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `no_panic` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
